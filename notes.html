                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>James is a self taught artist of dynamic talent. Building on each previous exhibition, James discovers and re-defines who he is through his paintings. James is known for his vibrant collection of portraiture, classic cars and other subjects in the realist realm, although his ability to adapt his style to suit any subject, has made him a popular commission artist. He has work in many collections both in New Zealand and overseas. In his new paintings, James explores new creative plains through texture and stroke, experimenting with techniques and deconstruction, refining and discarding as the piece develops its own.</p>
